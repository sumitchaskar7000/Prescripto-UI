# Prescripto-UI
Prescripto's goal is to bridge the gap between patients and healthcare providers by offering a modern, efficient, and secure healthcare management system. The website design will emphasize trust, accessibility, and convenience, using a clean, professional layout and interactive elements to guide users through the platform effortlessly.

The UI design in Figma will include a prototype that showcases user flows, such as booking appointments and managing health records, ensuring an excellent user experience across both desktop and mobile devices.
